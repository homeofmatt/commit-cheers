# Excitement! Fun! Hilarity!
Do you commit to git repositories daily and feel like you never receive the recognition you deserve?

Well now you can fix that with one curl command! Never feel undervalued again!

## Instructions:
1. Ensure you have admin access and cd into your local git repository of choice.
2. Run this one command:
  - `eval "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homeofmatt/commit-cheers/master/setup.sh)"`
3. All done!

Be sure to have your volume turned up (or at least on), and enjoy every commit from here on until you die! Or until you stop committing to git... probably more likely.
