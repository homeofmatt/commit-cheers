# Excitement! Fun! Hilarity!
Do you commit to Github repositories daily and feel like you never receive the recognition you deserve?

Well now you can fix that with one curl command! Never feel undervalued again!

### Run this one command:
`eval "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homeofmatt/commit-cheers/master/setup.sh)"`
Be sure to have your volume turned up (or at least on), and enjoy every commit from here on until you die! Or you stop committing to Github... probably more likely.
